A number guessing game is a simple and fun game where the computer or a player selects a random number, and the other player has to guess what that number is within a certain range. Typically, the game gives feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

Hereâ€™s a basic outline of how a number guessing game works:

###The Setup:

1.The computer chooses a random number within a given range (e.g., 1 to 100).
2. The player is asked to guess the number.

##The Game Loop:

1.The player guesses a number.
2.The game provides feedback: "Too high," "Too low," or "Correct!"
3.The player keeps guessing until they get the correct answer.

##End of the Game:

1.Once the player guesses the number correctly, they win, and the game ends.
2.The number of guesses can be tracked to see how quickly the player can guess it.
